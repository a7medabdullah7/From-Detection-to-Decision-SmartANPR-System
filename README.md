# From-Detection-to-Decision-SmartANPR-System
SmartANPR is a real-time AI traffic monitoring system that detects vehicles, extracts and reads license plates using OCR, tracks cars with unique IDs, estimates speed, and detects violations. Built with YOLOv8, OpenCV, object tracking, Streamlit, and Python, it processes video streams and images to simulate intelligent traffic systems.
